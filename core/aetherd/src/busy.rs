//! Is the channel in use?
//!
//! A station that transmits over someone else's contact is the single most effective way to
//! make a new mode unwelcome on a shared band, so nothing here transmits without asking this
//! first. The answer has to be right in both directions: a detector that cries busy on noise
//! makes the mode unusable, and one that misses a weak signal makes it a nuisance.
//!
//! # How the decision is made
//!
//! Occupancy is a power measurement against a noise floor the detector has to learn, because
//! an HF noise floor moves by tens of dB between bands, hours and antennas — no fixed
//! threshold in dBm or dBFS can work. The floor is tracked by **minimum statistics**: the
//! smallest smoothed power seen over a window of several seconds. The reasoning is Martin's
//! (*Noise power spectral density estimation based on optimal smoothing and minimum
//! statistics*, IEEE Trans. Speech and Audio Processing 9(5), 2001): any signal only ever
//! *adds* power, so over a window longer than a signal's gaps the minimum is the noise alone.
//! A window of a few seconds is long enough to see between syllables of speech and between
//! the frames of a digital burst, and short enough to follow a fade.
//!
//! The minimum is taken only over blocks where the level was **steady** — the raw block
//! powers within 3 dB over the last 200 ms. A receiver's AGC cuts its gain in a millisecond when
//! something strong appears anywhere in its passband (an adjacent station, a crash outside
//! the audio filter, nothing this detector can see) and lets it back over the next half
//! second; a two-minute recording of an idle band through an FTDX10 on AGC AUTO showed
//! seven such dips of 4–18 dB, and a plain minimum held each one for the whole window,
//! which drew the noise floor as a train of square pits on the panel and put the busy
//! threshold a decibel above the real noise. Noise is stationary and the gaps in a signal
//! are stationary at the floor; a gain transient is a step down and a ramp back, and is
//! never steady — so the gate keeps the theory and drops the artefact. It is judged on the
//! raw block powers, not the smoothed level: the smoother turns a step-and-ramp into a
//! rounded valley whose bottom looks steady for a few blocks, and lags a burst's end by
//! half a dozen blocks, which would hide a short gap. The price is that a gap shorter than
//! 200 ms does not show the floor — which is no worse than before, since the smoothed
//! level the old minimum was taken over needed about that long to fall to the floor after
//! a burst, and the ARQ turnarounds of the modes on the band exceed it. When no block in the window was steady, the floor learned before is
//! held: a channel that has been busy for five seconds without a quiet moment is still
//! measured against the noise that was there before it. A receiver whose AGC recovers
//! slower than about 15 dB/s (a SLOW setting) ramps gently enough to pass the gate, and
//! its dips will show; the field notes say which settings to use.
//!
//! On top of that:
//!
//! * a **hangover** keeps the channel marked busy for a moment after the power drops, so the
//!   gaps inside a burst do not read as a free channel;
//! * a detected preamble marks the channel busy outright, because the receiver being able to
//!   acquire a frame settles the question better than any power measurement can;
//! * the detector is **told when this station transmits**, and discards those blocks. Its own
//!   sidetone is not occupancy, and letting it into the floor estimate would poison it.
